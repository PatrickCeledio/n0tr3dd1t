What kind of data are we storing?

Two major objects:
    - Users
        - Id
        - Username
        - Email
        - Password
        - User type
        - Active (e.g. E-mail verification)
        - Date of creation

    - Posts
        - Id 
        - Title
        - Description
        - Photo path
        - Thumbnail
        - Active
        - Date of creation
        -fk_userid
Etc
    - Large file photos stored in database could slowdown the database
    - Storing username within post object may be wasteful
        - test123 -> 7 bytes (length of username) + 1 byte (collumn type) = (8 bytes * n amount of posts) * u amount of users 
            (e.g. 8*1000 = 8000 bytes * 1,000,000 users)
        - Instead, we should store user id
    - fk = foreign keys
        - Pointers to users
    - UUID for large applications

Submitting data from form 
    encType means what kind of data is being sent to the browser

    <form action="(localhost:3000)/dbtest/createUser" method="POST"
        encType="x-www-form-urlencoded">

        <input id="password" name="password"/>
        <input id="username" name="username"/>
        <input id="email" name="email"/>
        <input id="button" name="submit"/>
    
    </form>

Add user by backend
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" 
    -X POST 
    -d "username=tonytest&email=fake323232@mail.com&password=poopoo" 
    localhost:3000/dbtest/createUser
