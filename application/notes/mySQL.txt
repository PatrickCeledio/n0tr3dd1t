Diagram 
    - A visual representation of the database
        -SQL varchar usually holds 1 byte per character and 
        2 more bytes for the length information
Etc
    - Table names are plural
    - On a linux system, the longest varchar is 4096 characters
    - fk_userid and id must be the same data type

Time Zones
    - Databases should be time agnostic and UTC compliant

Foreign Keys
    - Cascade sets that if the user object changes, then the 
    related posts objects changes with it

Scripting
    - In the example of 
        CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `csc317project`;

        USE `csc317project`;
    
    The strings are enclosed in backticks, not single quotation marks

Statements
    - SELECT 
        - Grabs data from a table
        - e.g. SELECT * FROM users;
            - This code returns all the objects from the table `users`
        - WHERE adds a conditional statement
            - e.g. e.g. SELECT * FROM users WHERE id="blah"
    - INSERT
        - Inserts a row into a table with given information
        e.g.INSERT INTO `csc317project`.`users`
            (`id`,
            `username`,
            `email`,
            `password`,
            `usertype`,
            `active`,
            `created`)

            Replace the text enclosed in arrow pointers and
            fill in the values with strings enclosed in double quotation marks

            VALUES
            ("username", "test@mail.com", "1234", etc);
    - UPDATE
        - Updates the data of a given argument
        - e.g. UPDATE `csc317project`.`users`
               SET 
               `username` = "happyguy123"
                WHERE id=2
        - Conversely, DELETE works the same way, but deletes the data
    - SELECT users.username, posts.title, posts.description, 
            posts.photopath, posts.created, posts.fk_userid
        FROM USERS
        INNER JOIN posts ON users.id=posts.fk_userid;

Known Errors
    - Error Code: 1452. Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails 
        - The foreign key value does not exists. e.g. User 44 has to exist before we make a reference to it
